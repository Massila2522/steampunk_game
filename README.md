# Steampunk Game
This project is an example that was built along with a Youtube series showing how to create a 2D game with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 & HTML Canvas with no frameworks and no libraries. The tutorial I followed can be found [here](https://youtu.be/EvC3ge_puQk?si=07ZglEp76BSXBdtw).

# What I Learned
* Object oriented programming with JavaScript
* How to animate game characters
* Basics of game design
* Sprite animation and parallax backgrounds
* Create multiple different enemy types with different visuals and behaviours
* Write JavaScript code from scratch with no frameworks and no libraries
* Timing and timestamps

# Usage
To play the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

Alternatively, you can play the game directly [here](https://massila2522.github.io/steampunk_game/).
